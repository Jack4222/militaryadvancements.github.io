<div id="veh"class="text">The advancements to vehicles has been significant. By making the materials lightweight and improving armor to protect the driver and pasanger while also using less gas do to the weight of the vehicles. Vehicles have also being giving image tech like thermal imaging and and radar and sensors to improve the Vehicle situational awareness.
